The aim is to provide realistic simulated interviews, customised to the specific context as provided by the user. This takes their information and uses it as the basis for the simulation, which is then carried out by an agent built primarily upon GPT-4. 

The core of this design is an agentic apparatus built around the capacities provided by language models. The aim is to leverage their capacity for linguistic reasoning to provide the basis of a social intelligence, while using various other means to overcome their limitations in terms of planning, memory, and so on.
